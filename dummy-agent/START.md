### 3. Start Checkout

Click the "Buy" button on a product.

### 4. Review and Pay

- Shipping address is pre-filled
- Click "Pay Etsy" to complete

### 5. Order Confirmation

You'll see:
- âœ… "Purchase complete" screen
- Order details
- Delivery estimate
- Confirmation in chat

## What's Happening Behind the Scenes

```
1. User asks â†’ Agent responds with products
2. User clicks product â†’ Modal shows details
3. User clicks "Buy" â†’ Checkout modal opens
4. User clicks "Pay" â†’
   a) POST /api/agentic_commerce/delegate_payment (creates token)
   b) POST /api/checkout_sessions (creates session)
   c) POST /api/checkout_sessions/{id}/complete (completes order)
5. Shows completion screen
```

## Console Logs

Open browser console (F12) to see:
- âœ“ Payment token created: `vt_paypal_xxx` (Production) or `vt_card_xxx` (Demo)
- âœ“ Checkout session created: checkout_xxx
- Real API responses from Shopware

## Test the Full Flow

Watch the complete ACP integration in action:

1. **Product Discovery** - Conversational product search
2. **Product Selection** - Native UI product cards
3. **Checkout** - Embedded checkout experience
4. **Payment Delegation** - Real ACP token creation
5. **Session Management** - Real Shopware cart
6. **Order Completion** - Real order in Shopware
7. **Confirmation** - Native completion UI

## Stopping the Demo

Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where `npm start` is running.

Or:

```bash
lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill
```

## Troubleshooting

### Server won't start - Port 3000 in use

```bash
# Find what's using port 3000
lsof -i:3000

# Kill it
lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill

# Try again
npm start
```

### Can't connect to Shopware

```bash
# Check Shopware is running
curl http://localhost:80/api/_info/version

# Restart Shopware if needed
cd ../tests
./docker-start.sh restart
```

### Products show error

This is expected! The demo uses mock product IDs. The important part is:
- âœ… Payment tokens are created (real)
- âœ… API calls work (real)
- âœ… UI/UX flow is demonstrated
